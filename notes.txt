Things to mention at meeting with Darshan
- data-fitted smooth models exist for materials; should I make them inputs or should
  I just add the coefficients manually
- still waiting on Victor for the bracket updating methods
- need to look at video to get a reference for how to set up models in CADDEE
- mention that the VLM and rotor solvers weren't able to be pulled
- ask Darshan how the RPM for each flight condition is chosen
  - motor sizing done with rated speed as the design variable for optimizer in terms of sizing

========================================================================================

Things to mention at meeting with Zeyu/Shuofeng/Gabe
- confirm the state phi_aq for inductance MEC and the bracket
  - Important thing to consider: is phi_aq GUARANTEED to fall between 0 and phi_air?
    - it's done this way in the MATLAB code so I want to clarify this
    - << bracket should be between 0 and phi_air >>
- proper psi_m from the equations
  - the MTPA and flux weakening methods use phi_air, but I thought the phi in the 
    equations should be the magnet flux (it's denoted with a _m)
  - << psi_m is the air gap flux, NOT the magnet >>
- how is base speed selected?
  - << use rated speed to size motor; will let optimizer select this so that motor sizing
        changes with each optimization iteration >>

CADDEE NOTES
- CADDEE instantiation with some name 
- feature of aircraft (like rotor, wing, etc.)
  - idea in future is to automate parameters of feature from geometry side
- mission segments 
  - solver defined in mission segment must contain a feature
  - solver is a pure python class, but it includes an internal attribute that is a CSDL model
  - standard set of inputs (12 states + unique inputs that are needed for motor)
  - WE WILL DEFINE THE RATED SPEED AS ONE OF THESE INPUTS AS A DESIGN VARIABLE 
    - also potentially include the material model
  - add AllowableOperatingconditions as needed

========================================================================================
TO-DO:
  - add the analytical brackets 
    - inductance MEC model (DONE, NEEDS CHECKING) 
    - flux weakening (DONE, BUT METHOD MAY CHANGE SO REVISIT)
  - change the MTPA model to just the analytical solution (DONE)
    - the bracketing method requires solving the analytical method to set up the upper bracket
    - at that point, the computation is simple enough to do the analytical method
  - test the implicit operation models to check the variable bracket method
    - REQUIRES AN UPDATE OF CSDL, CHECK VICTOR'S LAST MESSAGE
  - set up the pip install method properly
  - add the models into the proper places based on notes from meeting with Darshan
